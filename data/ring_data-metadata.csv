variable,type,units,description
ring,numeric,,"Refers to the order of which rings are made on the tree with 1 being the first ring to n, being the last ring at time of sample"
resin.duct.count,numeric,,Number of resin ducts present in a given ring on a tree core
tag,string,,Unique tags for each tree sampled
calendar.year,numeric,years,The year of which the aforementioned ring was created
age,numeric,,"The age of each ring relative to when the tree was sampled.  Earlier rings will be the oldest, with the last ring created being 1 year old."
ring.width,numeric,centimeters,The width of the specific tree ring in centimeters
spcode,string,,USDA species code
DBH,numeric,centimeters,Diameter at breast height of trees sampled
BAF,numeric,,Basal area factor.   Number of trees surrounding sampled tree based on 10-factor gauge criteria.
mtn,string,,"Mountain range. CM=Chisos, DM=Davis, GM=Guadalupe"
date,string,,The date the tree was sampled.
gps.elev,numeric,meters,Elevation where tree was sampled according to GPS.
lon,numeric,degrees,"Latitude in decimal degrees, Spheroid WGS84"
lat,numeric,degrees,"Longitude in decimal degrees, Spheroid WGS84"
elev,numeric,meters,Elevation where tree was sampled according to topographic variables.
flow_accum,numeric,,Values range from 1-255.  Values are clipped from accumulation grid and uses flow direction grid for calculations.  
ldist_ridge,numeric,,Reclassified flow accumulation to threshold out values greater than 0.
ldist_valley,numeric,,Identifies areas of which water flowed into an area.
ldist_valley2,numeric,,Calculate downstream distance along a flow point
msd,numeric,,A measure of topographic dissections using multiple sized windows.
radiation,numeric,,Incoming solar radiation calculated for the whole year with a monthly interval and and hourly interval calculation.
relelev_l,numeric,,Relative l position channel to divide
relelev_z,numeric,,N/A
slope,numeric,degrees,The slope of which a tree is located on.  Reported in degrees.
z_ridge,numeric,,N/A
z_valley,numeric,,Value calculated by subtracting the elev layer from the z_layer.
zdist_ridge,numeric,,N/A
zdist_valley,numeric,,N/A
regional_precip,numeric,centimeters,Average yearly rainfall in the trans pecos region.  Values calculated by summing monthly values together
PDSI,numeric,,Palmer Drought Severity Index: Average yearly values calculated by determining the mean of all 12 months together
PMDI,numeric,,Modified Palmer Drought Severity Index: Average yearly values calculated by determining the mean of all 12 months together.
ring.area,numeric,centimeters squared,Total ring area present for each ring in the tree core.
bai,numeric,,"Basal Area Increment: Amount of growth put on by the tree for each year.  Is not specific to the core, but rather calculates the entire tree."
duct.density,numeric,,Value calculated by dividing the number of resin ducts present in a ring divided by the area of the ring within the tree core.
