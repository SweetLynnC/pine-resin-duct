# rings.R

# Read in tree ring coordinates from individual csv files, calculate ring
# widths and areas. Provides data frame "ring_data" to global namespace. The
# tree ring data files include a row for each ring and a final row giving the
# coordinates of the vascular cambium. So the final row of data is only used to
# calculate the width associated with the outermost ring (penultimate row of
# data).
