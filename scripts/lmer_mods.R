# plots and lme4 models

# Setting up models to determine the best model that explains what
# is happening with the data. Steps are as follows:
# 1. Look at all fixed variables when setting up full model.
# 2. Compare AIC values for regular, random intercept, and random slope.
#    Select model that has lowest AIC value.
# 3. Use afex::mixed() to get p values for the fixed effects in the model.
# 4. Drop non-significant effects based on results from mixed, and do new
#    model to include only significant effects.

# Models explore relationship to BAI and resin duct density.

#### Results of model

## Subsections

# P= .0314974
# Strobus>Ponderosae>Cembroides
# There is a signficant difference between subsections.  Specifically, 
# Strobus is greater than Ponderosae which is greater than Cembroides.
#  It seems that there is a signficant difference between strous and ponderosae
# and strobus and cembroides. It doesn't look like there is a signficant difference
# between cembroides and ponderosae in terms of ring width.

## Drought (PMDI_3yrlag)

# P= .0001151
# This has a signgificant overall effect.  When looked at graphically, you
# can see that as drought conditions decrease (PMDI increases) ring widths
# increase.  Pretty strong relationship here.

## Subsections:age

# Strobus>Cembroides>Ponderosae
# P= 9.382e-05
# It looks like there is a general overall negative effect. Based on fixed
# effect estimates shown in the summary, it seems that there is a stronger negative
# effect with Strobus than cembroides and ponderosae.  Based on t values, it seems that
# there is a signficant difference between cembroides and ponderosae, as well as strobus
# and ponderosae.

## Subsections : Drought (Pmdi_3yrlag)
# Strobus>Cembroides>Ponderosae
# P= .0035446
# As mentioned earlier, there is a general overall positive effect that as
# PMDI values increase, ring width increases.  That effect is least seen with 
# Ponderosae, but I beleive that is due to Arizonica not being affected by drought
# drought values since it is located in a canyon area.  Based on t values it looks
# like there is a signficant differnce between cembroides and strobus, and ponderosae
# and strobus.  Strobus seems to be the most responsive to drought conditions.

# Cembroides>Strobus>Ponderosae
# So there is a signficant difference between subsections and age. There are
# aso siignficant interactions between subsections and age, subsections and elev,
# and subsections and ring width.  I'll go further into those relationships below.

## Subsections
# Cembroides>Strobus>Ponderosae
# P= <2.2e-16
# As previously thought from looking at the data, cembroides trees have a larger 
# resin duct density than the other two subsections.  It looks like there is a signficant
# difference between cembroides and ponderosae as well as cembroides an strobus, but
# not a difference between ponderosae and strobus 


## Age

# P= 1.771e-11
# It appears that resin duct density decreases with age when
# looking at an overall effect.


## Subsections:Age
# Intercept: Cembroides>Ponderosae>Strobus
# P= .004628
# Intitial intercept has cembroides greater than strobus and ponderosae. It appears
# that there is a signficnat difference between cembroides and ponderosae as well as 
# cembroides and strobus, but not between ponderosae and strobus.


## Subsections:Elevation
# Intercept: Cembroides>Strobus>Ponderosae
# P= .042082
# Initial intercept has cembroides greater than Ponderosae and Strobus. It looks
# like there is a signficant difference between cembroides and ponderosae as well as
# cembroides and strobus.  When the mean logged resin duct density per tree is graphed
# by elevation and seperated by subsection, it shows that cembroides' duct density
# increases with increased elevation where ponderosae and strobus decrease with elevation.


## Subsections:Ring.width
# Intercept: Strobus>Ponderosae>Cembroides
# P= 5.634e-09
# This one is a little complicated.  If you graph each tree's relationship with 
# ring width and duct density there isn't a clear relationship established.  When
# the mean ring widths are graphed with the corresponding mean resin duct density for 
# each tree, a more clear relationship comes out.  Cembroides resin duct density has
# a strong negative relationship with ring width.  Pondderosae is slightly negative
# and strobus is slightly positive.  If you look at how these relationships change
# in respect to age, and interesting relationship comes out.  There is a strong
# negative relationship with resin duct density and ring width for the first 10 years
# of a trees life.   After that, the relationship becomes positive, so the greater the
# ring width, the greater resin duct density.
