# raster_data.R
# 
# This takes .asc files from topo_grids (download seperately), and
# creates a raster stack for each mountain range.  Temporary dataframes
# are produced with each tree's raster value for each raster file based
# on latitude and longitude. Values are then merged with the output of
# ring_data to create the final data frame with all relevant information
# to conduct analyses.  Information from here can most likely be merged
# into rings.R later on, but until this is perfected, I will keep as a 
# seperate R file.

# ldist_ridge2.asc seems to be the culprit since it's extent is different
# than the rest of the .asc files, but when I remove it, I still get the
# same error when I try to stack the rasters.  I have manually checked
# each .asc file's extent when converted to a raster layer individually
# and all of them have the same extent, except ldist_ridge2.asc. I can
# redefine the extent for all of them, but ldist_ridge2.asc is very 
# different from the rest of them which would make me lose a lot of
# information.
